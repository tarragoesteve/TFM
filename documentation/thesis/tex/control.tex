\section{Control}
So far we have analyzed our system as a continuous system.
However, we are using the Raspberry Pi to control the robot, so we will
be using digital control. It's a branch of control theory that uses
digital computers to act as system controllers.

In order to sample the position and the speed we use the rotatory encoders.
They count the number of flags so there is a constant to convert them in to radiants.

All our digital control was made in periodical loops. To get the speed we
divided the incremental position by the period of the loop.
