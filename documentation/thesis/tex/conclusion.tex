\section{Conclusion}
Thinking, designing and building a prototype is a big and rewarding challenge.
There are many thinks that do not work as expected and you need to iterate again
and find a solution to the problem. Some examples are too much deformation in the platform,
too noisy speed measurements or 3D printed parts that we couldn't unpack.

On the other hand we came out with a model using the fundamental mechanics equations, but we are missing
some frictions and other forces that do not appear in our model. This made our robot behave a little bit
different from expected than the simulations. With the flywheel mode the robot can hardly start moving and with
the pendulum mode the platforms need to turn a little to start and break.

For a possible following iteration I would recommend much more powerful motors and a more robust structure.
The robot now is not behaving perfectly but can move around more or less than expected as you can see in this
