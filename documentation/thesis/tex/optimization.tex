\section{Optimization}

\subsection{Restrictions}
As a reminder: $L$ is the length of the robot, and $w$ the width of the flywheel cylinders.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Not crashing with the ground at any inclination can be translated as:
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5cm]{img/flywheel_hole.jpg}
	\caption{Flywheel hole diagram}
	\label{fig:Flywheel hole diagram}
\end{figure}
\[r_{wheel}> \sqrt{(r_{flywheel} + b)^2+\frac{h}{2}^2}\]
\item We want to inserted the robot in to a external of diameter 0.5m so:
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5cm]{img/external_diameter.jpg}
	\caption{External diameter diagram}
	\label{fig:External diameter diagram}
\end{figure}
\[0.25 m > \sqrt{r_{wheel}^2 + L^2/4}\]
\item We can place all the devices:
\[L > 0.3m + w \]
\item Maximum weight of the robot: 5kg
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Cost function}
The function we would like to maximize is the maximum angle we can keep our speed using the pendulum system.
It's described in equation \ref{Maximum angle using pendulum system}:
\[sin(\alpha_{max}) = \frac{m_{cylinder} * (r_{max}- r_{min})}{m_{total} * r_{wheel}}\]
We have set $N$ = 2 (Number of cylinders) in order to maximize this function.

Also we have imposed a minimum $sin(\alpha_{max})$ for the flywheel system which was set to $0.3$.

\subsection{Results}
Our procedure has been making a grid of the three parameters of the robot design: $w$ (width of the cylinders),$r_{wheel}$ and $r_{flywheel}$.
We have fixed $r_{flywheel}$, iterated over the other two variables and keeped the best parameters for our cost function.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/optimization/sin.png}
	\caption{Plot of the sinus of the maximum inclination in which the robot can keep his speed.}
	\label{fig:Sinus plot}
\end{figure}
In figure \ref{fig:Sinus plot} we can see how the sinus of the flywheel is saturated to 1 and as long as it's possible it does not go below $0.3$.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/optimization/speed.png}
	\caption{Plot of the maximum speed that the robot can achieve.}
	\label{fig:Speed plot}
\end{figure}
In figure \ref{fig:Speed plot} we can observe that the pendulum systems allows as to get a much higher speed than the flywheel.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/optimization/parameters.png}
	\caption{Plot of the parameters that maximize the cost function.}
	\label{fig:Parameters plot}
\end{figure}
Just for reference this plot in figure \ref{fig:Parameters plot} shows which parameters maximize the cost function so we can then design the robot accordingly.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/optimization/mass.png}
	\caption{Plot of the mass for each configuration.}
	\label{fig:Mass plot}
\end{figure}
This plot in figure \ref{fig:Mass plot} shows us which is the total mass of the robot in each of the configurations.

Our selected parameters are:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
	 \hline
	 $r_{flywheel}$ & $r_{wheel}$ & $w$ \\
	 \hline 
	 8cm & 9cm & 7cm \\ 
	 \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

\subsection{Minimum section in the section of the flywheel}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/Shear_Moment_Diagram.png}
	\caption{Bendig moment diagram}
	\label{fig:Bendig moment diagram}
\end{figure}
The maximum bending moment is at the flywheel section:
\[M_y = \frac{P * L}{4}\]
Where P is the weight of the robot and L is the distance between the two wheels.

%The twisting moment $M_x$ in the body at the flywheel is the one we apply with the central motor.
%\[M_y = \tau_{motor}\]
%The pressure generated by this moment is:
%\[\tau=\frac{M_x}{\frac{1}{3}*}*R\]


\[I_y = \frac{2*b*h^3}{12}=\frac{b*h^3}{6}\]
\[\sigma=\frac{M_y}{I_y}*\frac{h}{2} = \frac{P*L}{48*b*h^2}\]
We are planning to build our body structure with aluminum:
\[\sigma_{al} = 400MPa = 4E8Pa\]
We will impose the relation:
\[b * 5 = h\]
And set a target P of $2000N$ and a maximum length of $0.5m$
\[\sigma_{al} = 4E8Pa = \frac{P*L}{48*b*h^2} = \frac{1000}{48*25*b^3} \]
Therefore:
\[b = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1000}{48*25*4E8}} = 0,001277182 m\]
We will use b=5mm and h=10mm from now on. Which is far more than what we need.
