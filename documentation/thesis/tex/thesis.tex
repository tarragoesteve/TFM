\abstracteng{
    This thesis is centered arround the design, construction and control of a 
    remote hoverboard. The main challenge of this project is the study of the 
    leaning control of the hoverboard platform and the restrictions it induce.

    Nowadays segways are a popular way of human transportation and there also exist segway robots. 
    Both, human-driven and autonomus segway robots have their speed determined by their inclination.
    (e.i. If you wish to go forward in a segway you should put your weight in the same forward).
    So in this systems the inclination is not a degree of freedom but a necessary consequence from moving.
    Unblocking this degree of freedom may help two-wheel robots perform new task as mesurments, taking images 
    or samples from other inclinations, avoiding obstacles, etc.

    We have studied diferrent mechanisms to control the leaning while allowing the movement of the robot.
    Then whe studied the dynamics of our system to deterimine it's dimensions and create and optimal design
    accordingly.
    
    This project also aims to provide a benchmark and an easy to build robot that help experiment with non-linear control methods.
