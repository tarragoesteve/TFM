\section{Objective}
The objective of this project is to design, build and run reinforcement learning experiments on a dynamic robot. We wish to make this experiments easy and cheap to reproduce so we will try minimize its components and fabrication cost. 

The chosen robot is inspired in a \textit{segway hover-board}, similar to the one in Figure \ref{fig:Picture of a commercial segway hover-board}. The two wheels are controlled with classic control algorithms and the inclination of the central body is controlled with a reinforcement learning algorithm.
