\section{Introduction}
In the IRI lab we have two segway robots, Tibi and Dabo show in figure
\ref{fig:Picture of Tibi and Dabo}. Both of them move the same way.
They must incline their body to compensate the wheel reaction. 
This may cause some problems when measuring with the sensors.
This fact also restricts the possible trajectories of the robots. 

We decided to build a prototype of segway robot that could control it's
inclination independently. The chosen robot is inspired in a \textit{segway hover-board}, 
similar to the one appearing in Figure \ref{fig:Picture of a commercial 
segway hover-board}. The two wheels are controlled with classic
control algorithms and the inclination of the central body is
controlled with a flywheel mechanism that we will discuss in section \ref{}.
