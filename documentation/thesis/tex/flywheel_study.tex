\section{Flywheel study}

\subsection{System of differential equations}
As described in figure \ref{fig:Flywheel force diagram} we will use two variables to describe the flywheel position: $r$, $\theta$ 
We will use the change of variables $\alpha =\pi/2 - \theta$

Using equation \ref{flywheel equation}:
\[\tau_{flywheel} = \ddot{\theta}*I_{flywheel}(r) + m_{cylinder} * g * (r - r_{max}) * \sin{\theta}\]
And that:
\[\ddot{r} * m = -m * g * sin(\pi/2-\theta) + F_{friction}\]
\[F_{friction} = F_{normal} * \mu\]
\[F_{normal} = -m * g * cos(\pi/2-\theta)\]
